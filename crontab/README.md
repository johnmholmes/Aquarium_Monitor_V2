#  Crontab

This page will be used to record any work I do with crontab

to edit the cron we need to go into a terminal window and type " crontab - e" and press enter and then scroll down to the bottom off the page and add the program we want the the Raspberry Pi to run a at certain times.

Here is the website I would recomend to work out what the schedule that you require.
