#  Heater Control

# 5 August update.

The tank will still be using the DD Aquarium controller as the main supply, however I may add a relay cutout incase the unit ever fails leving the heaters switched on. The reason for this is I do have one of their heater that does not have an inbuilt thermostat in it. In the number of years I have been using it, it has never failed but as will all old equipment they say you should replace them after so long.

# 4 August update.
Even though I have shown a few different ideas on the YouTube Channel I am Still experimenting with a few Ideas. In Video 10 I showed a node that brought all 3 sensors reading in an array which looked very good. However after playing around with it I am slowly looking at the first method again, as I can avoid the false readings at startup and after deploying the flows after changes.

I am still undecided whether I will use a GPIO pin on the Pi to control a solid state relay to turn on the emergency heater in the display or leave that to the ESP32.

The graphs and gauges are all sorted so that part of the controller is complete, Work is under way on the Raspberry Pi encloser which will be compeleted in the next few days, once complete the deisgnwill be finalised and a video will be produced
