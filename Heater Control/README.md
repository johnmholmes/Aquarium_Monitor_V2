#  Heater Control

Even though I have shown a few different ideas on the YouTube Channel I am Still experimenting with a few Ideas. In Video 10 I showed a node that brought all 3 sensors reading in an array which looked very good. However after playing around with it I am slowly looking at the first method again, as I can avoid the false readings at startup and after deploying the flows after changes.

I am still undecided whether I will use a GPIO pin on the Pi to control a solid state relay to turn on the emergency heater in the display or leave that to the ESP32.
