# ESP32 Sketches

This folder will hold various skecthes I create for the Esp32 modules. 

These nodes are going through an number of changes so be prepared for new features being added to them.

The esp32_fish_temp_mqtt_v1 is a single DS18B20 sensor on the 1 wire bus, and will drive a solid state relay to control a single back up heater in the main display tank. As I change the file it will get a revision letter update. Any changes will be minor from now on while the testing take place.
