# ATO Controller

This folder will hold various skecthes as I create them for the Esp32 Auto Top Off modules. 

   1. Version 2 was the first pubished version which was working but I was not happy with it.
   2. Version 3 has been changed so that it only uses 2 topics to send out the current state of the Sump ad the ATO barrel. it still controls the ato pump on pin 5 for 10 secods. I will be creating the flow changes as well and add them to the relevent folder in the next few days. This will also need a change to be made for the display module to use the new mqtt payloads. The new module is being tested now to check for bugs.
